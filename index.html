                            <br />Hello! My name is Frank Charles Lugola. I am
                            currently, a Senior at Luther College majoring in
                            Computer Science with a minor in History. For the
                            past four years at Luther College, I have been
                            exposed to working with technological skills that
                            have enabled me to build reliable software relevant
                            to modern society.<br />

                            <br />
                            I have acquired Full stack, Front- End, Backend, and
                            Security Engineering skills through courses in my
                            Computer Science curriculum backed by intensive
                            projects that have pushed me to understand these<br />

                            <br />I have a diverse knowledge base with
                            experience with programming languages such as
                            Python, Java, Javascript, and SQL. I have also
                            familiarized myself with relevant frameworks such as
                            React and Vue for frontend development and Flask,
                            Django, and Node.js for backend development.

                    <p class="lead">  Norse Mates is a College Roommate Finder Application developed by our Senior Project team. 
                        To create a comprehensive solution, we utilized React-Native, Node.JS, and PostgreSQL. My primary responsibility in the project was designing and developing a one-on-one chat feature to facilitate communication between potential roommates. This involved implementing the necessary components and functionality to ensure smooth and efficient messaging. Collaborating closely with the backend team, we employed POST requests to establish a secure login and registration system. 
                        By enabling users to create accounts and authenticate their credentials, we ensured the privacy and security of their personal information. 
                        In addition to the chat feature, I took the lead in developing the header and footer user interface elements. These components played a crucial role in enhancing navigation throughout the application. By implementing intuitive design principles and user-friendly interactions, our aim was to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users. To enable real-time chat functionality, 
                        I engineered a chat update feature for the one-on-one chat. 
                        Leveraging Socket endpoints, 
                        I implemented the necessary code to ensure that users could receive and view new messages instantaneously, enhancing the responsiveness of the chat system.

                     <h5> Mezani </h5>
                    <p class="lead">  During my journey of learning React, I embarked on developing an application called Mezani, which means "table" in Swahili. Mezani is a web-based movie sorting system that aimed to enhance the user experience. Leveraging my skills in JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and Lodash, I set out to create a robust and intuitive application.

                        To establish a solid foundation for the front-end, I utilized Bootstrap to construct the user interface. This allowed me to create reusable React components, resulting in a more efficient development process and an improved visual experience for users.
                        
                        In order to ensure proper organization of movies within the local database, I harnessed the power of Lodash. By utilizing its functionalities, I successfully implemented effective sorting and filtering mechanisms, enabling seamless navigation through the movie collection.
                        
                        To provide users with a personalized experience, I optimized the utilization of Bootstrap forms. This enabled the development of a simple yet intuitive login form, allowing users to access personalized features and preferences.
                        
                        Recognizing the importance of efficient data management, I implemented pagination within Mezani. This enhancement significantly improved the organization and accessibility of the available movies, allowing users to browse through multiple pages of movie listings effortlessly.

                     <h5>Gym Check-in App </h5>
                    <p class="lead">  I undertook the development of a comprehensive full-stack project, a Gym Check-In Application. To ensure efficient data management, I designed a robust database system utilizing SQLite3, allowing for secure storage and easy access to user data by the administrator.

                        To enhance functionality and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, I engineered the integration of Requests, enabling smooth interactions with relevant APIs.
                        
                        For an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, I leveraged the power of Bootstrap and CSS to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
                        
                        On the backend, I employed the Flask framework, utilizing its capabilities to handle HTTP requests and responses. Through the utilization of GET and POST methods, I ensured seamless user interactivity and an optimal user experience.
                        
        
                        
                        The culmination of these efforts resulted in a feature-rich Gym Check-In Application that efficiently manages user data, communicates with external APIs, presents an intuitive user interface, and can be accessed seamlessly online.

                        This Java application served as a debugging tool that enabled the users to detect errors in assembly language and also perform assembly language operations as directed by the instructions in the program. To design an interactive GUI framework, the use of Java Swing was utilized throughout the whole project. Furthermore, the project was organized using a Model-View-Controller framework which enabled a swift configuration of the specifications of the program. 
                        The program utilized Java libraries such as beans, io, lang, swing, and util which were essential for the functionality of the program.

                        For the front-end, I employed HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to create an intuitive user interface. On the back-end, I utilized Flask and Django, two powerful Python frameworks for backend development. With these frameworks, I implemented the functionality to compute the entropy of passwords and set the parameters for password generation.
                        
                        This application serves as an educational tool, highlighting the importance of strong passwords in ensuring information security. By providing users with secure password options, it promotes best practices in password management.

                            <p class="lead"> The JP Morgan Software Engineering virtual experience offered me the chance to explore life as a software engineer at JP Morgan Chase and acquire valuable technical skills. Throughout the program, I worked on tasks such as interfacing with stock price data, 
                                implementing open-source code for data visualization, and creating trading dashboards.

                                This immersive experience allowed me to develop practical skills in financial data analysis, 
                                Python programming, and utilizing JP Morgan Chase frameworks and tools like Perspective, React, and TypeScript.<br/>
                                 I also gained expertise in web application development, equipping me with the necessary skills to excel in the software engineering field.
                                
                                Upon completion, I received a prestigious certificate from JP Morgan Chase, validating my expertise in software engineering. By sharing my work and profile, I had the opportunity to stand out and catch the attention of the JP Morgan Chase HR team.
                                
                                Joining the JP Morgan Software Engineering virtual experience not only enhanced my technical abilities but also provided invaluable insights into the dynamic world of software engineering at JP Morgan Chase. It was a remarkable opportunity to build a solid foundation of skills and propel my career in the software engineering field.
