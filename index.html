                            <br />Hello! My name is Frank Charles Lugola. I am
                            currently, a Senior at Luther College majoring in
                            Computer Science with a minor in History. For the
                            past four years at Luther College, I have been
                            exposed to working with technological skills that
                            have enabled me to build reliable software relevant
                            to modern society.<br />

                            <br />
                            I have acquired Full stack, Front- End, Backend, and
                            Security Engineering skills through courses in my
                            Computer Science curriculum backed by intensive
                            projects that have pushed me to understand these<br />

                            <br />I have a diverse knowledge base with
                            experience with programming languages such as
                            Python, Java, Javascript, and SQL. I have also
                            familiarized myself with relevant frameworks such as
                            React and Vue for frontend development and Flask,
                            Django, and Node.js for backend development.

                                implementing open-source code for data visualization, and creating trading dashboards.

                                This immersive experience allowed me to develop practical skills in financial data analysis, 
                                Python programming, and utilizing JP Morgan Chase frameworks and tools like Perspective, React, and TypeScript.<br/>
                                 I also gained expertise in web application development, equipping me with the necessary skills to excel in the software engineering field.
                                
                                Upon completion, I received a prestigious certificate from JP Morgan Chase, validating my expertise in software engineering. By sharing my work and profile, I had the opportunity to stand out and catch the attention of the JP Morgan Chase HR team.
                                
                                Joining the JP Morgan Software Engineering virtual experience not only enhanced my technical abilities but also provided invaluable insights into the dynamic world of software engineering at JP Morgan Chase. It was a remarkable opportunity to build a solid foundation of skills and propel my career in the software engineering field.
